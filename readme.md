A branding concept mocking the UK brand [SuperDryÂ© JPN](https://www.superdry.com/) whom appropriates the _exoticism_ of Japanese culture in order to make its brand appealing to western audiences. I replaced **Japan** with **BCN**, instead of **Super** is **Hyper**, and instead of **dry** this is **wet**, like the typical weather in Barcelona ðŸ¤¡

I used this tiny project on purpose to practice the syntax of **SASS** in different scenarios that include SVGs. This webpage is optimized for Firefox, which apparently is the one that accepts all my tinkering.
